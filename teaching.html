Another instructor sent me a copy of the first two assignments (thanks Giancarlo!). Feel free to work through them at your leisure, so you can put them in once I have it up and running.

<h3>
Week 2
</h3>
<p>
Only one meeting. Some of you may have notices I got too much sun over the weekend.
<br>
more to come...
</p>

  
<h3>
Week 1
</h3>  
<p>
One thing I'm annoyed at myself for: I should have said, sometimes people use the word <b>point</b> to mean the <b>input</b>, and then use the word <b>value</b> to mean the <b>output</b>. (In fact, these are the words I prefer, but I think they are a little confusing for Calc I. That's why I was trying to stick with input/output, but you're supposed to know both.)
