<h3>
Week 2
</h3>
<p>
Only one meeting. Some of you may have noticed I got too much sun over the weekend.
</p>

<p>
There were some comments the other day on certain words, namely 'expression' and 'equation'. These are not 'official words' that I want to define, you know them well enough we can just use them like everyday words, but I did want to say a bit.
One issue in this discussion is that different people use these words in slightly different ways.
</p>
<p>
I'll say:
<br>

  Definition: An <b>expression</b> (in the variables x, y, z, ..., over the real number system) is a sum of products of numbers and functions of the variables.
<br>

  For example, "3x^3-5x+7+2/x-13/x^3", or "4x^sqrt(2) - 7 3^(-x)" are both expressions in the variable x.
<br>

In particular, we don't allow an equals sign, and we don't allow &lt (less than) or &gt (greater than) either. Also, notice this doesn't include something like "+-sqrt(x)", the 'plus-minus' symbol (if you wanted, you could allow this, but =, &lt, and &gt are *not* allowed).

<br>

  Definition: An <b>equation</b> is a pair of expressions separated by an equals sign.
<br>

  For example, "x^2 - 3x + 7 = 6/sqrt(x) - sqrt(x^3)/27" or "y = (3x+2)/(2x-3)" are equations.
<br>

You have all spent time 'solving equations'. This means, finding a simpler equation which is 'equivalent' to the one you started with.
Two equations are 'equivalent' if you can get from one to the other by applying a sequence of 'allowed operations' to each side of the starting equation.
</p>

<p>
Let me also mention the word 'formula', which again people use in slightly different ways.
<br>
Option 1: A formula is just another word for an equation.
<br>
Option 2: A formula is an equation where one side of the equation is just a single variable.
</p>

<p>
  So, the last equation above is also a 'formula' for "y" in terms of "x".
  As an exercise: 'solve' this last equation to get a formula for "x" in terms of "y". 

</p>

  
<h3>
Week 1
</h3>  
<p>
One thing I'm annoyed at myself for: I should have said, sometimes people use the word <b>point</b> to mean the <b>input</b>, and then use the word <b>value</b> to mean the <b>output</b>. (In fact, these are the words I prefer, but I think they are a little confusing for Calc I. That's why I was trying to stick with input/output, but you're supposed to know both.)
</p>

<p>
There's another, much more important thing for me to be annoyed by! A function has a unique output for any input. Unique as in there is only one. A function has only one output for any input. <b>A function has only one output for any input.</b>
</p>

<h3>A function has only one output for a given input.</h3>
