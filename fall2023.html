Notes from the fifth class:

Again, I hope it was clear that there are these things we do (add, subtract, multiply) with numbers, so we can do them with functions, and it's happening in the ranges of the functions.

Again again, one of the main things we can do with functions is compose them. Here the values of one function are used as inputs in another function, so the range of one should be inside the domain of the other. Still, any individual function has a domain and a range, and it is helpful to think of them as separate things. When you graph, the domain is on the horizontal ('x') axis, and the range is on the vertical ('y') axis.
</p>
  
<p>
Here are some notes for the fourth class:
<a href="">Sept 11 Notes</a>

Limits... the big L.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I wish I emphasized more: one of the interesting things about limits is the interplay between the domain and the range. 
In the symbolism, we have the 'x approaching a (from below, above)' below the 'lim', with the 'x's in the domain. 
We also have the 'f(x)' to the right of the 'lim' (almost like 'f' is an input for the 'lim' function...), with the values 'f(x)' in the range.
This is one reason for my nagging about functions having a domain and a range.
Another reason is in the first example of class: how many decimal places for sqrt(2) do you need to know to get however many decimal places for 2^sqrt(2)?
</p>

  
<h3>
Week 2
</h3>
<p>
Only one meeting. Some of you may have noticed I got too much sun over the weekend.
</p>

<p>
There were some comments the other day on certain words, namely 'expression' and 'equation'. These are not 'official words' that I want to define, you know them well enough we can just use them like everyday words, but I did want to say a bit.
One issue in this discussion is that different people use these words in slightly different ways.
</p>
<p>
I'll say:
<br>

  Definition: An <b>expression</b> (in the variables x, y, z, ..., over the real number system) is a sum of products of numbers and functions of the variables.
<br>

  For example, "3x^3-5x+7+2/x-13/x^3", or "4x^sqrt(2) - 7 3^(-x)" are both expressions in the variable x.
<br>

In particular, we don't allow an equals sign, and we don't allow &lt (less than) or &gt (greater than) either. Also, notice this doesn't include something like "+-sqrt(x)", the 'plus-minus' symbol (if you wanted, you could allow this, but =, &lt, and &gt are *not* allowed).

<br>

  Definition: An <b>equation</b> is a pair of expressions separated by an equals sign.
<br>

  For example, "x^2 - 3x + 7 = 6/sqrt(x) - sqrt(x^3)/27" or "y = (3x+2)/(2x-3)" are equations.
<br>

You have all spent time 'solving equations'. This means, finding a simpler equation which is 'equivalent' to the one you started with.
Two equations are 'equivalent' if you can get from one to the other by applying a sequence of 'allowed operations' to each side of the starting equation.
</p>

<p>
Let me also mention the word 'formula', which again people use in slightly different ways.
<br>
Option 1: A formula is just another word for an equation.
<br>
Option 2: A formula is an equation where one side of the equation is just a single variable.
</p>

<p>
  So, the last equation above is also a 'formula' for "y" in terms of "x".
  As an exercise: 'solve' this last equation to get a formula for "x" in terms of "y". 

</p>

  
<h3>
Week 1
</h3>  
<p>
One thing I'm annoyed at myself for: I should have said, sometimes people use the word <b>point</b> to mean the <b>input</b>, and then use the word <b>value</b> to mean the <b>output</b>. (In fact, these are the words I prefer, but I think they are a little confusing for Calc I. That's why I was trying to stick with input/output, but you're supposed to know both.)
</p>

<p>
There's another, much more important thing for me to be annoyed by! A function has a unique output for any input. Unique as in there is only one. A function has only one output for any input. <b>A function has only one output for any input.</b>
</p>

<h3>A function has only one output for a given input.</h3>
